Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
========================

## Overview

Using the UCI "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" dataset, we are going to collect the data into a tidy dataset and calculate averages by subject and activity.


## Data source

The data description: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The data:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## Assignment

The instructions request that an R script called run_analysis.r does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

## Files generated by run_analysis.r

### tidy_mean_and_std_data.txt
This file contains the output addressing the first 4 bullet points of the assignment, namely:
* merges test and traing data
* retains only the features corresponding to the mean or standard deviation of a measurement
* uses descriptive activity labels
* uses cleaned feature labels

### tidy_feature_averages.txt
This file addresses the last bullet point of the assignment, namely, averaging the feature data for each activities and subject.

The feature labels in this dataset have been appended with 'avg' to clarify that they do not correspond to single measurement.
